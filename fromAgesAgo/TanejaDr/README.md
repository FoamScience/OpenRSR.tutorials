This collection of test cases attempt to mimic, extract key differences, and build on top
of what ANKUR TANEJA did in his doctoral thesis at University of Illinois, 2017 with 
spectral elements method.

## Reservoir geometry
Wells pattern: five-spot, one producer
Reservoir initially saturated with oil
Only considers one quarter of the five-spot


## Test cases
- Scenario 01: Homogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4
- Scenario 02: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, square barrier with low permeability
- Scenario 03: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, square barrier (not meshed)
- Scenario 04: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, rectangle barrier (not meshed)
- Scenario 05: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, curved barrier (not meshed)
- Scenario 06: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, thin shale barrier (not meshed)
- Scenario 07: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, cornered thin shale barrier (not meshed)
- Scenario 08: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, curved high-permeability channel
- Scenario 09: Heterogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, multiple high-permeability channel

- Scenario 10: Homogenous, mu_w/mu_o = 4, two injectors, one producer
